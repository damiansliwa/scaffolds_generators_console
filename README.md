# README

This is a simple Rails application for testing scaffolds, generators, and the console.
Each of these features is located on a separate branch of this repository.
While studying the application structures in Ruby on Rails, I also worked with this remote repository to reinforce my understanding.

To see what's inside and start the application, please:
1. Fetch this repository
2. Using your preferred CLI, navigate to the 'scaffolds_generators_console' directory 
3. Run `bundle install` to install required dependencies 
4. Start the server using the command `rails server -p 3000` to run it on port 3000 
5. Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:3000 to view the website
